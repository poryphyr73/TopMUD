# TopMUD
 
This project aims to address the development of a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon), and provide a basic framework upon which a MUD can be built.

The framework is complete with:
- Telnet communications
- Login sequencing
- Command parsing/execution
- Data serialization

While this model does not serve as a full game that can be played, it attempts to encomapass a few major features of the MUD, and to work as a tool for development upon its basis.
